### 🔧 Configuration Files Created

1. **firebase.json** - Main Firebase configuration
   - Hosting: Serves frontend from `pnb-front-end/dist`
   - Functions: Deploys backend from `functions/`
   - Rewrites: SPA routing support

2. **functions/index.js** - Firebase Functions entry point
   - Express.js app wrapped as Firebase Function
   - CORS configured for your domain
   - All backend routes included

3. **functions/package.json** - Backend dependencies
   - Firebase Functions runtime
   - Express.js and middleware
   - Firebase Admin SDK

### 🌐 API Configuration

The frontend is configured to automatically use the correct API:
- **Development**: `http://localhost:5000/api`
- **Production**: `https://us-central1-pnbautobody-33725.cloudfunctions.net/api`

### 📋 Deployment Steps

#### 1. Build Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd pnb-front-end

# Build for production
npm run build
# This creates pnb-front-end/dist/ folder
```

#### 2. Deploy Backend (Functions)
```bash
# From project root
firebase deploy --only functions
```

#### 3. Deploy Frontend (Hosting)
```bash
# From project root  
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

#### 4. Deploy Everything
```bash
# Deploy both at once
firebase deploy
```
